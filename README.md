### What I learned

- Coding requires practice to implement whatever you have learnt. following a tutoril is great as it will help you develop the basic knowledge of what you are learning
properly declaring a class in HTML can greatly help when styling in css.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
    <div class="container"> understanding divs made it is easier to structure my website.
```
```the following css codes really helpded me understand how to position HTML divs. 
     body {
            background-color: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
            align-self: center;
            width: 1440px
          }

     .container {
          background-color: white;
          border-radius: 8px;
          height: 450px;
          position: relative;
          margin: 100px auto;
          width: 606px;
           }
```

```

### Continued development

I am going to buid a few more newbie projects to ensure that i better understand basic HTML Structure .
